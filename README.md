## Overview

We are looking to see how several metrics affect air quality of an area.

For this we will be looking at ...

We suspect that **walkablity** and **vehicle population** will have the biggest affect on air quality of the data we have access to.

## Dataset
We will be using data from [data.gov](https://data.gov/).
